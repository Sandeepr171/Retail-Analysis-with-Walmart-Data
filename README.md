Project - Retail Analysis with Walmart Data

Analysing and Building Machine Learning model for 45 stores of Walmart

Dataset Description
Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modelling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available.

In this project, we analysed Walmart’s 45 stores’ data and answered the following questions:
1.	Which store has maximum sales?
2.	Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation.
3.	Which store/s has a good quarterly growth rate in Q3’2012?
4.	Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Find out holidays that have higher sales than the mean sales in the non-holiday season for all stores together.
5.	Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights.
6.	Build a model.
